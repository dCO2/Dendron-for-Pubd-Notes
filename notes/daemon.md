Majority of my knowledge about daemons (through GPT-3.5), Ah!:

**Prompt**: "Can you give me an implemented example of a daemon from the linux operating system?"  

**GPT-3.5**: 
Certainly! In Linux, a daemon is a background process that runs independently of user sessions and performs various tasks. One classic example of a daemon is the "cron" daemon, which is responsible for executing scheduled tasks at specified intervals.

Here's a simplified example of how a daemon might be implemented in Linux using Python. Note that this example won't be as sophisticated as the actual "cron" daemon, but it should give you an idea of how daemons work:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import time
import os
import sys
import daemon

def daemon_task():
    while True:
        with open('/tmp/daemon_log.txt', 'a') as log_file:
            log_file.write("Daemon task executed at: {}\n".format(time.ctime()))
        time.sleep(10)  # Sleep for 10 seconds

def run_daemon():
    context = daemon.DaemonContext(
        working_directory='/tmp',  # Set working directory
        umask=0o002,               # Set file permissions
    )
    
    with context:
        daemon_task()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    pid_file = '/tmp/daemon_example.pid'

    if len(sys.argv) > 1 and sys.argv[1] == 'stop':
        if os.path.exists(pid_file):
            with open(pid_file, 'r') as f:
                pid = int(f.read())
            os.kill(pid, 15)  # Send SIGTERM to the daemon process
            os.remove(pid_file)
            print("Daemon stopped.")
        else:
            print("Daemon is not running.")
    else:
        if os.path.exists(pid_file):
            print("Daemon is already running.")
        else:
            with open(pid_file, 'w') as f:
                f.write(str(os.getpid()))
            run_daemon()
```

Explanation of the script:

- The script defines a `daemon_task()` function that writes a log entry to a file every 10 seconds.
- The `run_daemon()` function uses the `daemon` module to run the `daemon_task()` function as a background daemon process.
- The script can be executed with the command-line argument 'stop' to stop the daemon process if it's running.

Please note that creating a proper daemon in Linux involves several considerations like
- handling signals,
- logging,
- proper daemonization,
- and more.  
This is just a basic example to give you an idea of the concept. For production use, it's recommended to use established daemon libraries and follow best practices.
