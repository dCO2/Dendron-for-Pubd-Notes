- It is not enough to create just one note for a topic.
- Although if what is to be remembered is a trivial fact, then that's fine.
- But it is always better to look at a thought from different perspectives and generate many questions for each of those perspectives.
- It is easier to remember an idea this way
- See [[A note should be effortful]]
