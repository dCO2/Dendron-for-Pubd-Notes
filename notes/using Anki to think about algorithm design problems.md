- `August 15th`: Revising cards (i.e., problems, solutions, code) at a frequency of about 30 per day is inefficient strategy on memory. It is too much. You want to reduce the Maximum reviews per day to about 3.
  - To do this, I moved all ~364 cards tagged '`algorithm-design-problems`' to a new deck where the `Options` is correspondingly set.
  - On setting the Maximum reviews per day to about 3, Anki suggests "If adding 2 new cards... ...review limit should be at least 20." VIZ:
    - ![review limit should be at least 20](/assets/images/review%20limit%20should%20be%20at%20least%2020.png)
  - The desired Maximum reviews per day can still be set despite that.
  - Now there are 3 problems I should have working memory of for a couple of weeks before they fully become long-term.
    - The question now is; with the current 'options presets', "If I come across a certain 3-problems on day 1 (today), will I come across the same 3-problem set tomorrow?"
      - How do I set any of `Learning steps`, `Graduating Interval`, `Easy Interval`, `Insertion Order`; `Relearning Steps`, `Minimum Interval`, `Leech Threshold`, `Leech Action`, `Maximum Interval`, `Starting Ease`,  `Easy bonus`, `Interval Modifier`, `Hard Interval`, `New Interval`, so that on day 1 after seeing cards; (_Merge K Lists_, _Subsets_, and _Search a 2D Matrix_ ~+ _Kth Largest Element in an Array_ for example), I still see some of them on day 2 and a new one, even less of them and some more new cards on day 3. So that by the end of week 1, I very rarely see them again.
  - Something is wrong. I'm stiil seeing more than 3 cards per day from the new deck.
    - At this moment, my _Buffer_ superdeck has a _due decks_ number of 42, but all the subdecks have a total of 23 _due decks_. The diff commes from the new ADP subdeck. It seems the options preset didn't work.
      - The temporary solution is; reduce the Maximum reviews per day for the _Buffer_ superdeck from 1000 to 20.
  - It is day 2 (`August 16th`) and I did not come across the cards from day 1 I was expecting.  
  - (`August 18th`): I have now "buried" the cards that are due tomorrow so that I, instead, come across **ONLY** the required 3(+1) cards I want to keep tabs on.  
  - (`August 20th`): I have to continue burying the unwanted cards to get to see what I want.
  - (`August 24th`): still haven't figured this out properly yet.
  - (`August 24th`): status: put on hold
