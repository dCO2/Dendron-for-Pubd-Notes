- See [[how should anki decks be organized]]
- The statement _"Anki is not a bucket, it is a pipe"_ is guiding mental model to help properly conceive of the nature of spaced repetition systems (SRS)
- It is not specific to only the Anki™ implementation of an SRS.
- It is usually the case that knowledge (of whatever kind) "sits", stagnant as a sprawl of text, on the pages of books and in bookshelves
- Or it is the case that the knowledge is in/as the voice of a speaker
- And it is the reader/listener/learner that has to walk towards the shelves or listen to the voice in order to assimilate said knowledge
- What an SRS is meant to do, instead, is make the knowledge itself "visit" the reader/listener/learner in a manner of recall
    - And this should be done at some specific schedule that ensures the learned material is understood longterm.
- When conceived this way, any piece of knowledge/information that must be brought into the SRS must be brought in with the intention that it HAS to be remembered.
- If this is not the case, the knowledge/information becomes a burden and affects the overall experience of the learner when using the SRS.
- The SRS then is not a stagnant bookshelf or a bucket of notes (where information sits still) but something that facilitates the flow of information
- It is like a pipe
- A bucket is a reference—i.e., Textbook, Encyclopedia, Knowledge, "Training", Obsidian or Notion. A pipe is a channel—a conduit, a tap, a faucet—that helps control how much conversion—between Knowledge and knowhow—you are doing.
- I used to want the decks to be a reminder of the things I needed to learn, the things I was learning. But (now that) (if) I remember the few things I'm interested in (without anki's reminder), I don't need anki to serve that function. I don't need a deck for "New Words" (when learning new words) because I'd know (or, it will be a habit) to be on the look out for interesting words and add it to my date-specific superdeck.
