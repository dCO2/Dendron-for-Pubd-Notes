- Visual information is—in most cases—easily recalled than other forms of information like speech or text.
- Hence, as best practice, whenever the answer for a question in a note is best visualized as an image, use it instead of text
- When text and an image should be side-by-side in the answer section of a note, the text should come first. This has been found to be usually better than the image coming first.
