- [Ant Design](https://ant.design/) is self-tagged "the world's second most popular UI framework," I don't know enough of how true that is.
- I am bothered by its slow (& clunky-)rendering time. I used it for the textarea and search input-UIs for netpin (See [[Documenting Netpin]]). It is also used by Dendron (the framework with which this site is built).
