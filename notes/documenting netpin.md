I rushed through a quick app last week within about 10 days. I made use of [[Next-js]], TailwindCSS, Prisma, and [[Ant Design]]. It is a basic notes app and is [deployed on Netlify](https://netpin.netlify.app/) and [Vercel](https://netpin-0-1-1.vercel.app/). The app, however, doesn't work (as built) in deployment as it does in production (remark: All API endpoints were unresponsive)

This note (and other linked notes) details & explains the choices I rushed through while building the app and also documents thoughts on alternative choices that might be preferable for cleaner & effective code.

Proxy Talking Points:

- [[how was the apps state handled]]
- [[how was the note-card text-input implemented]]
- [[how was login implemented]]
- [[how was search implemented]]
- [[why is the search and note-card area disabled by default]]
- [[how are the user-notes persisted into a database]]
