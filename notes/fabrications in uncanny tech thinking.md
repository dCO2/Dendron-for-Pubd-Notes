_`for now;`_ `'tech' as in procedural digital-world; not as in oil-drilling or nuclear fusion or bioengineering &c.`

- What are the various ways [[Autocompletes]] have been rendered as visual [[Interfaces]]?  
- [[Autocompletes]] in [[VR]]/3D design.  
- Autocompleting a Sculpture.  
- [[Interfaces]] hide [[Metadata]].  
<!-- - Everything is said & done and yet the world has enough [[Clearance]] for something new.   -->
- There is a sense that until `Canvas` or `Graph View` _(from softwares like [[Obsidian]], [Roam]())_ is engineered as something in which **_augmented work_** can take place, all that can be gotten from views like those is some asset with mere artistic/satisfying value.  
- What will be the nature of [[VR]] interfaces where augmented work can actually take place?  
- A website's not a singleton Blackboard that everyone has read & write access to. But then how do you implement such a blackboard?
  - Figma
  - [[WebSockets]]
