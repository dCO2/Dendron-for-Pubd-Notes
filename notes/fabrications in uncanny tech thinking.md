_`for now;`_ `'tech' as in procedural digital-world; not as in oil-drilling or nuclear fusion or bioengineering or etc.`

What are the various ways [[Autocompletes]] have been rendered as visual [[Interfaces]]?  
[[Autocompletes]] in [[VR]]/3D design  
Autocompleting a Sculpture  
[[Interfaces]] hide [[Metadata]]  
Everything is said & done and yet the world has enough [[Clearance]] for something new  
There is a sense that until `Canvas` or `Graph View` _(from softwares like [[Obsidian]], [Roam]())_ is engineered into something in which **augmented work** can take place, all that can be gotten from views like those is an asset with mere artistic/satisfying value.  
What will be the nature of [[VR]] interfaces where augmented work can actually take place?
