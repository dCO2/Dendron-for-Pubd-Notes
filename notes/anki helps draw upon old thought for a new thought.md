- Anki helps move from an old thought to a recent thought so that moving from a recent thought to an old one becomes easier
- In my review session today—29th August 2022, I was shown a particular note for a concept I had been thinking about. I created the note on the 7th of July 2022. This was before I had a conversation around the topic of the note with a friend recently—August 27th 2022. My mind did not think about the note when we had the conversation. I guess the note had been infrequent during my review sessions. But on seeing the note today, and meditating on it, my mind was reminded of the conversation I had had with my friend. This is basically a kind of serendipity, a salience of ideas–Anki fosters serendipitous living.
- In this case, the old thought is actually old because it was “ankified”
