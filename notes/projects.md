I rushed through a quick app last week within about 10 days. I made use of [[Next.js]], TailwindCSS, Prisma, and Ant Design. It is a basic notes app and is [deployed on Netlify](https://netpin.netlify.app/) and [Vercel](https://netpin-0-1-1.vercel.app/). The app, however, doesn't work (as built) in deployment as it does in production (remark: All API endpoints are unresponsive).  

[[documenting netpin]] details & explains the choices I rushed through while building the app and also documents thoughts on alternative choices that might be preferable for cleaner & effective code.
