_While working on some app I cannot remember, I had a brief thought of explaining my thought process as I wrote the app. I wanted to show just how the constraints and processes in the interface of an app is specified in the web of textual code. One way to do this is to explain, showing the interface and the related snippet(s) of code side-by-side, so I had the thought of finding lazy & quick ways of screengrabbing only code that..._ (See [[documenting codeprop]]).

_I rushed through a quick app last week within ~10 days in order to learn about the libraries & tools I made use of, including; [[Next-js]], TailwindCSS, Prisma, and [[Ant Design]]. It is a basic notes app, [deployed on Netlify](https://netpin.netlify.app/) and [Vercel](https://netpin-0-1-1.vercel.app/). The app, however, doesn't work in production (i.e., deployment) as it did in development (remark: All API endpoints are currently..._ (See [[documenting netpin]]).

_In an attempt to learn React with hands-on projects, I built a simple single-page site that uses the Google Books API to obtain a list of books related to a user-selected search-query. The user then is able to add any of the books to a shelf. The app was not built with specific real-world use-case in mind but to test my skill at using React to build..._ (See [[documenting plain-net-lib]]).

_Why learn Algorithm design? “It is usually the case that when engineers learn algorithm design, they do so not primarily because it is fascinating to think about technical problems but because getting a FANG job is a big motivation..._ (See [[documenting p-knuth]]).

_I began actively working on ways to improve my memory when I realized I could not learn anything properly and longterm without a kind of external structure—somewhere to "put" the many concepts I was learning, and something to help revisit them. The precise history of events escape me but reading <a href="https://andymatuschak.org/prompts/">Andy Matuschak's article</a> inspired me to actually begin work on the project I had been postponing..._ (See [[documenting p-mnemosyne]]).
