- It is fun!
- "It is usually the case that when engineers learn algorithm design, they do so not primarily because it is fascinating to think about technical problems but because getting a FANG job is a big motivation. The prospects of getting a FANG job doesn't excite me anymore. I just, now, want to reach back to that initial spark that made me find something really fascinating about the implementation of computer algorithms. The genesis, most of the time is mathematics. The beauty of it. The promise that by understanding some fact deeply, you can see and appreciate its beauty in some other thing."
