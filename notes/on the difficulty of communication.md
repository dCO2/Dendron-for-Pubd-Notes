There's something you'll do to your ears or the muscles of your eardrums that will make it possible for you to hear (more clearly) whatever happens inside your head (or more accurately; inside your _nasal cavity_). As if you turned your ears inside-out; Your voice, your chewing, your hum, etc.^anchor-one

I've never read this somewhere and this is not common knowledge in my social groups because there's no particular "use" for this information; there's no name we've given the act of doing this. I've probably not searched the internet though, but this is the point: There are many (common) phenomena like this about our bodies or experience in general that is not immediately a part of the societal(or communal) consciousness (information that I know you know, we know), but becomes so if someone names the phenomenon.

One of the difficulties of communicating things like this is that for some "internal actions", there's just not anyway for our eyes to _see_ and easily mirror that particular action, the way a baby seeing a person jump can also jump.

This is one of the reasons learning is difficult. When a teacher reveals the thought that goes behind solving a problem, it still takes some work on the part of the student to be able to (approximately) mirror how the teacher thought that made them solve the problem.

A student, inevitably, has to come to an understanding of how to think about problems in their own original way.

Now the way you follow along with what the teacher says, i.e, the way you reduce uncertainty about what is being learnt, is by make quick assumptions; i.e, "I don't know exactly what you mean by that but it seems to mean this to me, so I'll assume it is that and see how your explanation being revealed fits into the explanation I'm forming in mind and back-correct/retrace on from there" 

#todo: Good teaching, Good studenting ("learning" being too broad): _i.e., What makes a good teacher? What makes a good student?_
