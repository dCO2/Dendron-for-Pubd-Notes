#### From EPI
- Design Problems
	- Design a spell checker
    - So I'm guessing: _Given some string of whitespace-separated words, check if the words are correctly spelled?_
    - How do you obtain a collection of correctly spelled words?
    - How do you do a comparison?
	- Design a solution to the stemming problem
    - What is the stemming problem?
      - For example, consider the words "jumping," "jumps," and "jumped." The stemming process would reduce all of these words to their common root, "jump."
