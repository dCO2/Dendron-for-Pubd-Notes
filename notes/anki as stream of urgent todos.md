- A todolist is a reminder of tasks you need to get done. And each task have varying levels of urgency.
- Bringing that model to bear on the nature of SRS systems, it is true to say that all notes in an SRS system represent equally urgent tasks that have to get done.
- If the tasks are not done, they accumulate. And this is very unwanted in SRS systems. See [[SRS is not a bucket SRS is a pipe]] and [[Anki laziness]].
