This is [Caleb's](https://caleb-x0.netlify.app/) public notes page. Not quite a [digital garden](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners), and also unlike [Andy's working notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes).

One reason I'm experimentally implementing this is to understand if & how "quick, linked, and atomic" note-taking can help realize, remember, & learn (how to make better) design decisions when working on quick (or slow) software engineering projects. Of course, it does help but this is a demonstration of exactly how it helps. This is the initial reason for publishing these notes. With time, they might document other [[projects]].

_Why not [Obsidian Publish](https://obsidian.md/publish)? (It is Priced)._  
_Why not your existing website? (It is old, doesn't have desired features)_
