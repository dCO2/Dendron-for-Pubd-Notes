You've stumbled on [Caleb's](https://caleb-x0.netlify.app/) public notebook. You can conceive of this as a sketchbook—i.e., rough, incomplete, and sometimes sparse. Hence, you might not get the full-gist of any one random page in the notebook. It is meant to help me elaborate/consolidate on my work & thoughts as a software engineer. This is not quite a [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history), and also unlike [Andy's working notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes).

I built this (experimentally & publicly) with [Dendron](https://www.dendron.so/), specifically, to understand if & how "quick, linked, and atomic" note-taking can help realize, remember, & learn (how to make better) design decisions when working on quick (or slow) software engineering projects. Of course, it does help—that makes this is a demonstration of exactly how it helps.

Check out my growing list of [[projects]]!
